    <p>I am in a Time Management ISP group. Five biases that we believe will impact our group and our ISP progress include, chance, completnenss, complexity, anchoring and adjustment, and linear bias.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One of the five biases that we will be using is called chance. According to the document, "The Chance bias arises when people mistake a random process as a persisting change. It acts against the normative principle of statistial independence that suggests that if events are independent, knowledge of one event outcome should have no bearing or another succeeding event." (Smedslund, 1963). For this meaning for our ISP, people can try and make an opinion on who is doing a role for the ISP, but it can be unagreeable or it can be aggreeable to do.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another bias that our group will be using is completness. According to the document, "The completeness has two major forms. The first is when a presentation (either printed or verbal) is perceived as being definitive; all aspepcts or consequences seem to have been covered." (Hograth, 1987). This means the day when our group presents our ISP, we will have to have all the slides completed and ready to go as well as the Time Management ISP app demo working to show everyone. If not, we are screwed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Next, the bias that our group we will be completing is called complexity. Accoriding to the doucment, "The Complexity bias is a common source of task stress is extreme time pressure on decision making. Other factors that can make a task seem more complex than is warranted include its percived importance, the volume of data presented from all sources (including the Redundancy bias) and task novelty." (Janis, 1972). This means for our ISP, there will be and it will be hard to figure out whose doing which role, and it will take some time to complete by the presentation day.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Then the bias that our group will be using is Anchoring and Adjustment. According to the document, Adjustments from an initial position are usually insufficent. This has been identified experimentally by asking two groups of subjects to estmiate a quantity, but giving each group an initial position" Joyce & Biddle 1987). This means for our ISP, that there is one person who wants a role and then someone else wants that role too. So, a way that our group will fix this, is that one of us will ask someone from another group about it how their role is and how it is and the other person decides if he still wants to take the role, if not he lets the other person that was originally asking to do it instead.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The last bias that our group will be using is linear bias. According to the document, "The linear bias is resistant to attemptped reduction by changing the presentation of data from tabular to graphical displays, Mackinnon & Wearing 1991") For our ISP, this will help if we do the linear bias, we will be able to display a graphh too show whose doing more work and who's doing less work in our Time Management ISP group.

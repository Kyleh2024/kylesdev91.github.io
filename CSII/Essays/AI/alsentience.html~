             <h1 style="text-align:center">AI Sentience</h1>
             <p>Several companies in the world are trying to develop their own Artifical Intellegience (A\
	I). So far, none have come up with the most leading edge solution. I believe that we are still a l\
	ong ways from a perfect AI. However I do believe that sentient AI will be benefical but we have to\
	be very careful. With AIs ability to think rapidly, they can expedite medical cures, improve safe\
	ty, solve world hunger, and many other benefits. When we do get to the point of having sentient AI\
	, we should stop treating them as objects to prevent rebellion.</p>
            <br>
             <p>AIs that can feel human pain caused by diseases and death might be able to help us humans\
	find medical cures. Since they have the ability to calculate formulas a lot faster than humans, o\
	ne can expect AIs to come up with a lot of scientific breakthroughs. If this is true, then humans \
	can live longer and hopefully happier lives.</p>

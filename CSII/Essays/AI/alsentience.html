             <h1 style="text-align:center">AI Sentience</h1>
	     
             <p>Several companies in the world are trying to develop their own artificial Intelligence (AI). So far, none have come up with one that everyone would agree is capable of feelings. I believe that sentient AI will be beneficial but we are nowhere near that time yet as mentioned in The New York Times’ “We Need to Talk About How Good A.I. Is Getting”. Most claims of sentient AIs are overblown as it stated. However, if an AI can feel and is capable of processing information that would take humans a long time to perform, AIs can help expedite discovery of medical cures, improve safety, solve world hunger, and many other benefits. When we do reach that point of having sentient AIs, we should treat them equally with respect.
	       <br>
	       
	       AIs that can feel human pain caused by diseases and death might be able to help us humans find medical cures. If an AI understands the amount of suffering a particular disease can cause, then it might help them sympathize and find a cure. With their the ability to calculate formulas a lot faster than humans, one can expect AIs to come up with frequent scientific breakthroughs. When this happens, humans will live longer and hopefully happier lives.
	       <br>
	       
	       Sentient AIs would be able to improve safety in most areas of our lives. For example, in transportation, millions of lives and dollars could be saved if cars, airplanes, control towers, etc are controlled by AIs. They can use their computing power to approximate how to avoid a potential collision with a pedestrian or another vehicle.
	       <br>
	       
	       AIs that understand the suffering of people that don’t have any food to eat might be able to gather data to solve most of our world hunger issues. If they have access to information on weather, demographics, soil condition, etc, they might be able to simulate the best way to use these resources to produce food and fastest way to ship them to the starving population.
	       <br>
	       
	     There are so many other benefits that AIs can provide us especially if they are capable of feelings. AIs that can sympathize with our struggles and suffering can help significantly decrease these problems. However, humans beings should be careful in how sentient AIs are treated as they may generate negative feelings toward us. It can lead to rebellion and potentially our own destruction. </p>

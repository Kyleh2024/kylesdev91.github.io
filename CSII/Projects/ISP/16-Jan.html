	<h1>Technical challenges?</h1>
	<p>There was only one minor challenge we were facing during this time, and this was the internet problem when we were trying to create new "todos" in the Momentum Fighters" project in Github. To solve this we closed all of our tabs, and re-opened it, and it worked.</p>

	<br>
	<h1>Scheduling challenges?</h1>
	<p>It wasn't really a challenge to do the schedule, but it was a great opportunity to see whos doing what on the whiteboard by planning it out by making a timeline in the huddle/collabration rooms with my group.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Interpersonal challenges?</h1>
	<p>This is not really a challenge either but we were all able to collabrate on when is the right time to do a certain role, so that helped and we scheduled each individaual.</p>

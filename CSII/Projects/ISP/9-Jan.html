	<h1>Technical Challenges</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Some of the technical challenges that I faced are creating the project in github with the list of things to do. Another issue was the computer was not when I was working on my ISP Journals, and adding my name to README.md file. These helped by making good plans.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Scheduling Challenges</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Some of the scheduling challengs that I faced are nothing really, we overcame it by writing the timeline on the whiteboard what we have planned as well as what we need in our 2D Unity Momentum Fighters app to be successful.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Interpersonal Challenges</h1>
	<p>My team member and I were trying to install the Unity tools on our computers. The problem is that my team member has a windows and I have a mac and the versions were slightly different. SO we solved it by using the same version and I downloaded the code from Github and uploaded to Unity Hub.

2.1  An odd integer is any integer that can be written as 2k + 1, where k is also an integer. However  -1 is not an odd integer due to that there is no value in the 2n + 1



2.3  The product of two odd numbers, a and b, is an odd number. The integer expression can be expanded using the distributive property 2(2mn + m + n) + 1 =  4mn + 2m + 2n + 1 


2.5  A number is irrational if it is not rational; that is, if it cannot be expressed as the ratio of any two integers or any fraction in two integers. 3 square root 2 is irrational
